{"id":"Synaxis-0hr","title":"Create Comprehensive Test Suite for Synaxis.Contracts","description":"Objective: Create unit test project for Synaxis.Contracts with comprehensive coverage of message types, serialization, immutability, and contract validation. Context: Contracts are data shapes that will be serialized/deserialized across process boundaries (HTTP, gRPC, etc.), so testing must verify serialization compatibility, immutability guarantees, and record semantics. Test Categories: (1) Construction Tests - Verify records can be constructed, Verify required properties enforced, Verify optional properties work with init, Verify object initializer syntax works. (2) Immutability Tests - Verify records are immutable after construction, Verify with-expression creates new instance, Verify init-only properties cannot be set after construction. (3) Serialization Tests - Verify JSON serialization works (System.Text.Json), Verify protobuf compatibility (if using protobuf-net), Verify records serialize/deserialize correctly, Verify null handling in serialization. (4) Equality Tests - Verify records have value equality, Verify equality ignores reference identity, Verify GetHashCode is consistent. Directory Structure: tests/Synaxis.Contracts.Tests/ containing Messages/ChatMessageTests.cs (Can_Be_Constructed, Is_Immutable, Has_Value_Equality, Serializes_To_Json), Messages/ChatResponseTests.cs, SerializationTests.cs (All_Messages_Serialize_To_Json, All_Messages_Deserialize_From_Json, Null_Handling_Works), ImmutabilityTests.cs (Records_Are_Immutable, With_Expression_Creates_New_Instance). Test Examples: [Fact] public void ChatMessage_Can_Be_Constructed() { var message = new ChatMessage('user', 'Hello'); Assert.Equal('user', message.Role); Assert.Equal('Hello', message.Content); } [Fact] public void ChatMessage_Is_Immutable() { var message = new ChatMessage('user', 'Hello'); // Should not compile: message.Role = 'assistant'; }. Project File: Tests/Synaxis.Contracts.Tests.csproj references Synaxis.Contracts, uses xUnit, FluentAssertions, System.Text.Json for serialization tests. Coverage Target: \u003e80% line coverage, 100% of public message types tested.

{"id":"Synaxis-1rsp","title":"Fix MA0002 IEqualityComparer Warnings","description":"\n# Context \u0026 Rationale\n\nThis issue addresses MA0002 warnings about string comparisons that should use explicit `IEqualityComparer\u003cstring\u003e` instead of default equality operators. The MA0002 analyzer (Meziantou.Analyzer) identifies string comparisons that may have unexpected behavior due to culture-specific rules or case sensitivity issues.\n\n**Why this matters:**\n- String comparisons using `==` or `!=` may have unexpected behavior\n- Default string comparison is culture-sensitive in some contexts\n- Explicit comparers make intent clear and prevent bugs\n- TreatWarningsAsErrors=true means these warnings block builds\n\n# Technical Details\n\n**Warning Pattern:**\n```csharp\n// ❌ MA0002: Use IEqualityComparer\u003cstring\u003e for string comparison\npublic bool IsValid(string value)\n{\n    return value == \"expected\";  // Culture-sensitive comparison\n}\n\n// ❌ MA0002: Case-sensitive comparison may fail unexpectedly\npublic bool FindUser(string name)\n{\n    return users.Any(u =\u003e u.Name == name);  // Case-sensitive\n}\n```\n\n**Correct Patterns:**\n\n**Option 1: Use StringComparer for explicit comparison:**\n```csharp\n// ✅ Ordinal comparison (fast, culture-invariant)\npublic bool IsValid(string value)\n{\n    return string.Equals(value, \"expected\", StringComparison.Ordinal);\n}\n\n// ✅ OrdinalIgnoreCase for case-insensitive comparison\npublic bool FindUser(string name)\n{\n    return users.Any(u =\u003e string.Equals(u.Name, name, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase));\n}\n```\n\n**Option 2: Use StringComparer with LINQ:**\n```csharp\n// ✅ Using StringComparer with Contains\npublic bool ContainsUser(string name)\n{\n    return users.Contains(name, StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase);\n}\n\n// ✅ Using StringComparer with Dictionary\nvar dictionary = new Dictionary\u003cstring, User\u003e(StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase);\n```\n\n**StringComparison Options:**\n\n| Comparison | Use Case |\n|------------|----------|\n| `Ordinal` | Fast, culture-invariant, exact match |\n| `OrdinalIgnoreCase` | Fast, culture-invariant, case-insensitive |\n| `CurrentCulture` | User-facing comparisons, culture-aware |\n| `CurrentCultureIgnoreCase` | User-facing, case-insensitive |\n| `InvariantCulture` | Persisted data, culture-invariant but slower |\n| `InvariantCultureIgnoreCase` | Persisted data, case-insensitive |\n\n**Implementation Approach:**\n1. Run `dotnet build -warnaserror` to identify all MA0002 warnings\n2. For each warning, analyze the string comparison:\n   - Determine if comparison should be case-sensitive or case-insensitive\n   - Determine if culture-aware comparison is needed\n   - Choose appropriate `StringComparison` value\n3. Replace `==` or `!=` with `string.Equals()` or `string.Compare()`\n4. For LINQ operations, use `StringComparer` parameter\n5. Run build again to verify warning is resolved\n6. Repeat until all MA0002 warnings are resolved\n\n**Finding MA0002 Warnings:**\n```bash\ndotnet build -warnaserror 2\u003e\u00261 | grep \"MA0002\"\n```\n\n**Common Scenarios:**\n\n1. **Configuration keys**: Use `OrdinalIgnoreCase`\n   ```csharp\n   // ✅ Configuration keys are typically case-insensitive\n   if (string.Equals(key, \"ConnectionString\", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))\n   ```\n\n2. **File paths**: Use `OrdinalIgnoreCase` on Windows, `Ordinal` on Linux\n   ```csharp\n   // ✅ File paths on Windows\n   if (string.Equals(path, expectedPath, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))\n   ```\n\n3. **User input**: Use `CurrentCulture` or `CurrentCultureIgnoreCase`\n   ```csharp\n   // ✅ User-facing comparisons\n   if (string.Equals(userInput, expected, StringComparison.CurrentCultureIgnoreCase))\n   ```\n\n4. **Internal identifiers**: Use `Ordinal`\n   ```csharp\n   // ✅ Internal identifiers should match exactly\n   if (string.Equals(id, expectedId, StringComparison.Ordinal))\n   ```\n\n5. **HTTP headers**: Use `OrdinalIgnoreCase`\n   ```csharp\n   // ✅ HTTP headers are case-insensitive\n   if (string.Equals(header.Name, \"Content-Type\", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))\n   ```\n\n# Guardrails \u0026 Constraints\n\n**MUST:**\n- Replace string comparisons with explicit `StringComparison` or `StringComparer`\n- Choose appropriate comparison type based on use case\n- Run `dotnet build -warnaserror` after each batch of fixes\n- Ensure all tests pass after changes\n- Consider culture sensitivity of comparisons\n\n**MUST NOT:**\n- Add `\u003cNoWarn\u003e` to suppress warnings\n- Use `#pragma warning disable` except as temporary measure\n- Break existing functionality\n- Change comparison semantics without understanding impact\n\n**SHOULD:**\n- Use `Ordinal` or `OrdinalIgnoreCase` for performance-critical code\n- Use `CurrentCulture` for user-facing comparisons\n- Document why specific comparison type was chosen\n- Review tests to ensure they cover comparison behavior\n\n**SHOULD NOT:**\n- Use `InvariantCulture` unless necessary (slower than Ordinal)\n- Change comparison semantics without updating tests\n- Ignore culture-specific requirements\n\n# Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] All MA0002 warnings are resolved\n- [ ] `dotnet build -warnaserror` passes with zero MA0002 warnings\n- [ ] All unit tests pass (`dotnet test --no-build`)\n- [ ] No new warnings are introduced\n- [ ] Code review completed\n- [ ] String comparison behavior is well-documented\n\n# Dos and Donts\n\n**DO:**\n- Choose appropriate `StringComparison` based on use case\n- Use `Ordinal` for internal identifiers and performance-critical code\n- Use `OrdinalIgnoreCase` for case-insensitive comparisons\n- Use `CurrentCulture` for user-facing comparisons\n- Review tests to ensure they cover comparison behavior\n\n**DONT:**\n- Suppress warnings without fixing\n- Change comparison semantics without understanding impact\n- Use `InvariantCulture` unnecessarily (slower)\n- Break existing functionality\n\n# RFC 2119 Requirements\n\n**MUST:**\n- Fix all MA0002 warnings before claiming completion\n- Use explicit `StringComparison` or `StringComparer`\n- Use `dotnet build -warnaserror` for verification\n- Preserve all existing functionality\n\n**MUST NOT:**\n- Add `\u003cNoWarn\u003e` elements to any project file\n- Break existing tests\n- Introduce new warnings\n- Change comparison semantics without updating tests\n\n**SHOULD:**\n- Choose appropriate comparison type based on use case\n- Document comparison behavior choices\n\n**SHOULD NOT:**\n- Use `InvariantCulture` unless necessary\n","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"rudimar@outlook.com","created_at":"2026-02-15T20:02:57Z","created_by":"Rudimar Ronsoni","updated_at":"2026-02-15T20:02:57Z"}

{"id":"Synaxis-3sl","title":"Create Synaxis.Abstractions Project - Zero-Dependency Foundation Interfaces","description":"Objective: Create the foundational NuGet package that defines all interfaces and abstractions for the Synaxis SDK with zero external dependencies, targeting .NET Standard 2.1 for maximum compatibility. Context: This is the most critical package in the entire ecosystem - it defines contracts that transports implement (ICommandExecutor, IStreamExecutor), providers implement (IChatProvider, IEmbeddingProvider, etc.), application code consumes (ICommand{T}, IStreamRequest{T}), and external developers extend (custom providers, custom behaviors). Breaking changes here require major version bumps and force all consumers to update. Architectural Decisions: (1) Use Marker Interfaces (Empty Interfaces) - Choice: public interface ICommand{out TResponse} { } (empty). Rationale: Marker interfaces provide type safety without imposing constraints, allow type system to enforce only command types passed to executors, keep interface minimal and extensible. Alternative Considered: Base classes with virtual methods. Rejected Because: Base classes impose inheritance hierarchy, limit flexibility, create versioning challenges. (2) Generic Type Parameters for Command/Response Types - Choice: ICommand{TResponse} with covariant out parameter. Rationale: Covariance (out TResponse) allows assignment compatibility (ICommand{object} can accept ICommand{string}), crucial for middleware and pipeline scenarios. Benefit: Enables flexible pipeline composition and type-safe command handling. (3) Async-Only API with ValueTask - Choice: ValueTask{T} instead of Task{T}. Rationale: ValueTask is more efficient for synchronous hot paths (can avoid allocation when result available immediately), aligns with Mediator library. Trade-off: Slightly more complex mental model than Task, but better performance. (4) IAsyncEnumerable for Streaming - Choice: IAsyncEnumerable{TResponse} for streaming commands. Rationale: Native .NET streaming abstraction, works well with async/await, cancellation, and LINQ, supported by C# 8.0+. Alternative Considered: IObservable{T}, custom stream interfaces. Rejected Because: IAsyncEnumerable is modern .NET standard for async streams. (5) CancellationToken on All Async Methods - Choice: Every async method accepts CancellationToken cancellationToken = default. Rationale: Proper async/await hygiene requires cancellation support throughout call stack, default parameter makes it optional for callers. Consequence: All implementations must respect cancellation tokens. (6) .NET Standard 2.1 Target - Choice: Target netstandard2.1 instead of net10.0. Rationale: Maximum compatibility - can be consumed by .NET Core 3.0+, .NET 5+, .NET Framework (via compatibility shims), Mono, Xamarin. Trade-off: Cannot use latest C# features requiring runtime support, but records and nullable reference types work fine. Alternative Considered: Multi-targeting (netstandard2.1;net10.0). Rejected Because: Adds complexity for marginal benefit; netstandard2.1 is sufficient. (7) No Implementation Code - Choice: Interfaces and minimal types only, no classes with logic. Rationale: This is abstraction layer, implementation goes in Synaxis package, keeps dependencies zero and surface area minimal. Exception: Small utility records or structs that are pure data. (8) Nullability Enabled - Choice: Nullable enabled in project file. Rationale: Null reference types are modern .NET standard, provides compile-time safety and better developer experience. Consequence: All reference types must be annotated (string? vs string). (9) Treat Warnings as Errors - Choice: TreatWarningsAsErrors true. Rationale: Foundation code should be pristine, warnings indicate potential issues that should be fixed not ignored. Consequence: Build fails on any warning (including XML documentation warnings). Directory Structure: src/Synaxis.Abstractions/ containing Commands/ (ICommand{T}.cs, IStreamRequest{T}.cs, INotification.cs), Execution/ (ICommandExecutor.cs, IStreamExecutor.cs), Providers/ (IProviderClient.cs, IChatProvider.cs, IEmbeddingProvider.cs, IImageProvider.cs, IAudioProvider.cs, IRerankProvider.cs), Routing/ (IProviderSelector.cs, IRoutingStrategy.cs, IRoutingContext.cs), Auth/ (IAuthenticationContext.cs, IApiKeyCredential.cs). Key Implementation Details: ICommand{TResponse} is empty marker interface with covariant out parameter, ICommandExecutor.ExecuteAsync uses ValueTask{TResponse} with CancellationToken default, IStreamExecutor.StreamAsync returns IAsyncEnumerable{TResponse}, IProviderClient has Name property and IsHealthyAsync method. Project File Requirements: TargetFramework netstandard2.1, LangVersion latest, Nullable enable, TreatWarningsAsErrors true, GenerateDocumentationFile true, PackageId Synaxis.Abstractions, Version 0.1.0-alpha. Build Validation: dotnet build produces zero warnings, dotnet list package shows zero dependencies, dotnet pack produces NuGet package. Acceptance Criteria: Project builds successfully, zero warnings enforced, zero external dependencies verified, target is netstandard2.1, all public types have XML documentation, nullable reference types enabled and annotated, can be packed into NuGet package, all marker interfaces defined, execution abstractions defined, provider abstractions defined, auth abstractions defined, routing abstractions defined. Risks: Interface design doesn't account for future requirements (mitigation: keep interfaces minimal, add methods via extension methods or new interfaces), .NET Standard 2.1 too limiting (mitigation: can multi-target later if needed).","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","owner":"rudimar@outlook.com","created_at":"2026-02-08T12:05:32Z","created_by":"Rudimar Ronsoni","updated_at":"2026-02-08T13:15:49Z","closed_at":"2026-02-08T13:15:49Z","work_type":"mutex"}

{"id":"Synaxis-4gd","title":"Foundation: Establish SDK Architecture with Clean Abstractions, Versioned Contracts, and Architectural Decision Records","description":"Creates the architectural bedrock for Synaxis SDK-first design. This epic implements the foundational layer that all other components depend upon. Includes: (1) Synaxis.Abstractions - zero-dependency interfaces targeting .NET Standard 2.1 with marker interfaces (ICommand{T}, IStreamRequest{T}, INotification), execution abstractions (ICommandExecutor with ValueTask, IStreamExecutor with IAsyncEnumerable), provider contracts (IProviderClient, IChatProvider, IEmbeddingProvider, IImageProvider, IAudioProvider, IRerankProvider), routing abstractions (IProviderSelector, IRoutingStrategy), and auth abstractions (IAuthenticationContext, IApiKeyCredential). (2) Synaxis.Contracts - versioned data contracts in V1.Messages namespace (not DTOs), command interfaces (IChatCommand, IChatStreamCommand, etc.), auth contracts, and error model (SynaxisError with severity levels and categories). (3) ADRs 012-015 documenting SDK-first architecture, transport abstraction with Mediator, explicit registration pattern, and contracts versioning strategy. This is the critical path blocking all other work. Must achieve: zero dependencies in foundation packages, semantic naming (Messages not DTOs), stable interfaces designed for longevity (breaking changes require major version bumps), versioned contracts under V1 namespace, XML documentation on all public APIs, nullable reference types enabled, TreatWarningsAsErrors enforced. Success criteria: both packages build with zero warnings and zero external dependencies, test projects created with \u003e80% coverage, all 4 ADRs written and approved. Risks: Interface design mistakes are extremely expensive to fix later and require major version bumps, versioning strategy mistakes force ecosystem-wide updates, .NET Standard 2.1 vs .NET 10 decision affects compatibility matrix.","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"rudimar@outlook.com","created_at":"2026-02-08T12:04:09Z","created_by":"Rudimar Ronsoni","updated_at":"2026-02-08T13:17:07Z","closed_at":"2026-02-08T13:17:07Z","work_type":"mutex"}

{"id":"Synaxis-5cmi","title":"Fix SA1200 Using Directive Placement","description":"\n# Context \u0026 Rationale\n\nThis issue addresses SA1200 warnings about using directive placement. The SA1200 analyzer (StyleCop) requires that using directives be placed BEFORE the namespace declaration, not inside it. This is part of the C# 10 file-scoped namespace requirement and improves code organization and readability.\n\n**Why this matters:**\n- Using directives inside namespaces is a pre-C# 10 pattern\n- File-scoped namespaces require using directives before namespace\n- Consistent placement improves code readability\n- Required by AGENTS.md code generation standards (Section 21.2)\n- TreatWarningsAsErrors=true means these warnings block builds\n\n# Technical Details\n\n**Warning Pattern:**\n```csharp\n// ❌ SA1200: Using directives must be placed outside of namespace\nnamespace Synaxis.Features.Authentication\n{\n    using System;\n    using System.Collections.Generic;\n    \n    public class AuthService\n    {\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Correct Pattern (File-Scoped Namespace):**\n```csharp\n// ✅ Using directives BEFORE namespace declaration\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\n\nnamespace Synaxis.Features.Authentication;  // File-scoped\n\npublic class AuthService\n{\n}\n```\n\n**Correct Pattern (Block-Scoped Namespace - if required):**\n```csharp\n// ✅ Using directives BEFORE namespace declaration\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\n\nnamespace Synaxis.Features.Authentication\n{\n    public class AuthService\n    {\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Implementation Approach:**\n1. Run `dotnet build -warnaserror` to identify all SA1200 warnings\n2. For each warning, locate the file with using directives inside namespace\n3. Move all using directives to BEFORE the namespace declaration\n4. Consider converting to file-scoped namespace (C# 10+ style)\n5. Run build again to verify warning is resolved\n6. Repeat until all SA1200 warnings are resolved\n\n**Finding SA1200 Warnings:**\n```bash\ndotnet build -warnaserror 2\u003e\u00261 | grep \"SA1200\"\n```\n\n**Alternative: Auto-format with dotnet format:**\n```bash\ndotnet format style --verify-no-changes\n```\nNote: This may fix many SA1200 warnings automatically.\n\n**Converting to File-Scoped Namespaces:**\n\nBefore (Block-Scoped):\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\n\nnamespace Synaxis.Features.Authentication\n{\n    public class AuthService\n    {\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAfter (File-Scoped):\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\n\nnamespace Synaxis.Features.Authentication;\n\npublic class AuthService\n{\n}\n```\n\n# Guardrails \u0026 Constraints\n\n**MUST:**\n- Move using directives to BEFORE namespace declaration\n- Follow file-scoped namespace pattern (C# 10+)\n- Run `dotnet build -warnaserror` after each batch of fixes\n- Ensure all tests pass after changes\n- Maintain alphabetical ordering of using directives\n\n**MUST NOT:**\n- Place using directives inside namespace declaration\n- Add `\u003cNoWarn\u003e` to suppress warnings\n- Use `#pragma warning disable` except as temporary measure\n- Break existing functionality\n- Remove necessary using directives\n\n**SHOULD:**\n- Use file-scoped namespace syntax (C# 10+)\n- Keep using directives organized and alphabetical\n- Consider using `dotnet format` to auto-fix many warnings\n- Remove unused using directives\n\n**SHOULD NOT:**\n- Mix using directive placement styles within a file\n- Keep block-scoped namespaces if file-scoped is possible\n\n# Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] All SA1200 warnings are resolved\n- [ ] `dotnet build -warnaserror` passes with zero SA1200 warnings\n- [ ] All unit tests pass (`dotnet test --no-build`)\n- [ ] No new warnings are introduced\n- [ ] Code review completed\n- [ ] All files use file-scoped namespaces (C# 10+ style)\n\n# Dos and Donts\n\n**DO:**\n- Move using directives before namespace declaration\n- Use file-scoped namespace syntax\n- Keep using directives organized\n- Use `dotnet format` to auto-fix warnings\n- Remove unused using directives\n\n**DONT:**\n- Place using directives inside namespace\n- Suppress warnings without fixing\n- Break existing functionality\n- Keep block-scoped namespaces unnecessarily\n\n# RFC 2119 Requirements\n\n**MUST:**\n- Fix all SA1200 warnings before claiming completion\n- Place using directives BEFORE namespace declaration\n- Use file-scoped namespace syntax (C# 10+)\n- Use `dotnet build -warnaserror` for verification\n- Preserve all existing functionality\n\n**MUST NOT:**\n- Add `\u003cNoWarn\u003e` elements to any project file\n- Place using directives inside namespace\n- Break existing tests\n- Introduce new warnings\n\n**SHOULD:**\n- Use file-scoped namespace syntax throughout codebase\n- Keep using directives organized and alphabetical\n\n**SHOULD NOT:**\n- Keep block-scoped namespaces if file-scoped is possible\n","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"rudimar@outlook.com","created_at":"2026-02-15T20:03:13Z","created_by":"Rudimar Ronsoni","updated_at":"2026-02-15T20:03:13Z"}

{"id":"Synaxis-724","title":"Create ADR-012: SDK-First Package Architecture","description":"Objective: Write Architectural Decision Record 012 documenting the SDK-first package architecture, dependency rules, and versioning strategy. Context: This ADR explains why Synaxis uses a multi-tier package structure with strict dependency rules, and how it enables multiple consumption patterns (SDK, Gateway, SaaS). Content Requirements: Title: ADR-012: SDK-First Package Architecture. Status: Proposed (Accepted after review). Context: Synaxis must support multiple consumption patterns - Library (developers embed SDK), Gateway (DevOps deploy standalone), SaaS (customers use cloud API). Need clean architecture enabling all three without coupling. Decision: Create 4-tier package structure - Tier 1 Foundation (Synaxis.Abstractions, Synaxis.Contracts, optional Synaxis.Primitives) with zero deps, Tier 2 Core Implementation (Synaxis with Mediator, Synaxis.Providers.{Name} individual packages), Tier 3 Infrastructure (Synaxis.Client, Synaxis.Extensions.*), Tier 4 Transports \u0026 Adapters (Synaxis.Transport.*, Synaxis.Adapters.*), Tier 5 Server (Synaxis.Server thin composition). Dependency Rules: Abstractions never references Implementation, Contracts never references Implementation, Abstractions should not reference Contracts (avoid bidirectional), Contracts should not reference Abstractions (avoid bidirectional), if shared primitives needed create Synaxis.Primitives, all heavy deps go in Implementation or Adapters only. Unified Versioning: All first-party packages share same version (1.0.0, 1.1.0), breaking changes in Abstractions only on major versions. Consequences: Positive - clean separation, consumers pick only what they need, testable architecture, plugin architecture; Negative - more packages to manage, breaking changes affect entire ecosystem, steeper learning curve.

{"id":"Synaxis-7fq","title":"Create ADR-015: Contracts Versioning Strategy","description":"Objective: Write Architectural Decision Record 015 documenting the namespace-based versioning strategy and stability tiers for contracts. Context: Synaxis.Contracts used by SDK consumers (compile-time, long-lived) and SaaS API (runtime, must evolve gracefully). Need strategy allowing evolution without breaking consumers. Content Requirements: Title: ADR-015: Contracts Versioning Strategy. Status: Proposed. Context: Contracts used by SDK (compile-time dependency) and SaaS (runtime wire format). Need evolution without breaking, N-1 compatibility, easy to understand. Decision: Use namespace-based versioning with stability tiers. Namespace Versioning: Synaxis.Contracts.V1.Messages for current, Synaxis.Contracts.V2.Messages for next version (breaking changes). Each major version gets own namespace, minor versions don't change namespace, breaking changes only in major versions (V1 -\u003e V2). Stability Tiers: Tier 1 Most Stable (Synaxis.Abstractions) - marker interfaces, core abstractions, breaking changes only on major versions (2.0, 3.0), goal never break. Tier 2 Stable (Synaxis.Contracts.V1) - message types, command interfaces, error types, breaking changes only on major versions, goal N-1 compatibility. Tier 3 Evolving (Synaxis.Contracts.V1+) - new optional properties, new message types, new commands, additive changes only no breaking changes, goal backward compatible within major version. Messages Namespace (Not DTOs): Data types in Messages namespace, not Dtos. Version Compatibility: Within major version (1.0 -\u003e 1.1) - can add new optional properties, add new message types, add new commands, cannot remove properties, change types, or change behavior. Major version bump (1.x -\u003e 2.0) - can make breaking changes, new namespace V2, old namespace remains available (deprecation period), consumers migrate gradually. N-1 Compatibility: Support current version (V1) and previous version (V0 deprecated). After releasing V2: support V2 (current), V1 (previous), drop V0. Deprecation timeline: 12 months or next major version whichever is longer. Error Handling Across Versions: Error codes and structure remain stable, new error codes can be added, old error codes never removed (only deprecated). Consequences: Positive - clear versioning, predictable breaking changes, N-1 compatibility reduces upgrade pressure, namespace makes version explicit; Negative - namespace clutter with multiple versions, migration complexity, more packages to maintain (V1, V2, etc.), IntelliSense pollution. Implementation Notes: Start with V1 no V0, plan for V2 within 12-18 months, use Obsolete attribute before removal, provide migration guides, automated API compatibility checking in CI.

Background: The existing documentation was written for the previous monolithic InferenceGateway architecture and is no longer accurate for the SDK-first design, but contains valuable historical context that must be preserved. The docs/adr/ directory contains 11 approved ADRs (001-011) that remain relevant and must stay in place. Files to Archive - Root Level: README.md, AGENTS.md, IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md, IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md, TEST_COVERAGE_REPORT.md, BILLING_CACHE_IMPLEMENTATION.md. Files to Archive - docs/ Level: API.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, CONFIGURATION.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, COVERAGE_BASELINE.md, DEPLOYMENT.md, IDENTITY_API_KEY_IMPLEMENTATION.md, IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md, IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md, SECURITY.md, SYNAXIS_AGENTS_IMPLEMENTATION.md, TESTING.md, WEBSOCKET_REALTIME_UPDATES.md, workflows.md, 20260204-IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md, 20260204-TESTING.md. Directories to Archive: docs/plan/, docs/ops/, docs/reference/. Files to Preserve (DO NOT MOVE): docs/adr/README.md, docs/adr/001-stream-native-cqrs.md through docs/adr/011-dynamic-model-registry.md. Implementation: Use git mv to preserve history and blame information. Commands: mkdir -p docs/archive/2025-02-08 \u0026\u0026 git mv README.md docs/archive/2025-02-08/ \u0026\u0026 git mv AGENTS.md docs/archive/2025-02-08/ \u0026\u0026 git mv docs/API.md docs/archive/2025-02-08/ \u0026\u0026 ... (repeat for all files). Final commit: git commit -m 'docs: archive legacy documentation for SDK architecture transition - preserves ADRs 001-011'. Validation Checklist: After archival, running ls docs/ shows only 'adr/ archive/', running ls docs/adr/ shows all 11 ADR files plus README.md, running ls docs/archive/2025-02-08/ shows all archived files, git log shows descriptive commit, no build errors from missing documentation references. Decision Rationale: Use git mv over regular mv to preserve file history and blame information; this maintains audit trail and allows historical research. Risks: Breaking relative links in archived documents (mitigation: acceptable as archived docs are historical reference only), losing important documentation (mitigation: archiving preserves everything, nothing deleted), confusion about where current docs live (mitigation: new README will clarify SDK-first architecture).","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","owner":"rudimar@outlook.com","created_at":"2026-02-08T12:05:10Z","created_by":"Rudimar Ronsoni","updated_at":"2026-02-08T13:15:49Z","closed_at":"2026-02-08T13:15:49Z","work_type":"mutex"}

{"id":"Synaxis-a1r","title":"Transport Layer - HTTP, gRPC, and WebSocket Implementations","description":"Implements transport-specific packages that expose Synaxis functionality over different protocols. Each transport is a separate NuGet package that can be optionally consumed. All transports use ICommandExecutor and IStreamExecutor from Foundation, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of protocol. Scope: (1) Synaxis.Transport.Http - REST API with JSON, Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming, ASP.NET Core controllers, authentication middleware, OpenAPI/Swagger support. (2) Synaxis.Transport.Grpc - gRPC services with Protocol Buffers, server and client code generation, streaming support via gRPC server streaming, reflection service for debugging. (3) Synaxis.Transport.WebSocket - Raw WebSocket support for real-time bidirectional communication, frame handling, connection management. Key Design Pattern: All transports are thin adapters that deserialize requests into Commands, call ICommandExecutor/IStreamExecutor, serialize responses. No business logic in transports - pure protocol adaptation. Dependencies: Epic 1 (Foundation), Epic 2 (Core Implementation - need handlers to execute). Success Criteria: All three transport packages build with zero warnings, HTTP transport handles REST and SSE correctly, gRPC transport handles unary and streaming calls, WebSocket transport handles frames, Each transport has explicit DI registration (AddSynaxisTransport*), Each transport has endpoint mapping (MapSynaxisTransport*), Integration tests prove end-to-end functionality. Risks: Protocol differences cause inconsistent behavior (mitigation: all use same executor), Performance differences between transports (mitigation: document and benchmark), WebSocket complexity (mitigation: well-tested frame handling).","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"rudimar@outlook.com","created_at":"2026-02-08T12:04:40Z","created_by":"Rudimar Ronsoni","updated_at":"2026-02-08T14:40:35Z","closed_at":"2026-02-08T14:40:35Z","work_type":"mutex"}

{"id":"Synaxis-ajl","title":"Create ADR-013: Transport Abstraction with Mediator","description":"Objective: Write Architectural Decision Record 013 documenting the use of MartinOthamar.Mediator for CQRS and the transport abstraction pattern. Context: Synaxis must support HTTP, gRPC, WebSocket, SignalR, Microsoft.Agents, MCP - all with same business logic. Need clean abstraction to avoid duplication. Content Requirements: Title: ADR-013: Transport Abstraction with Mediator. Status: Proposed. Context: Multiple transport protocols needed (HTTP/REST for compatibility, gRPC for performance, WebSocket for real-time, SignalR for .NET, Agents for orchestration, MCP for protocol). All must share same business logic. Decision: Use MartinOthamar.Mediator as CQRS backbone with clean transport abstractions. Architecture: Transport Layer (REST, gRPC, SignalR, Agents, MCP) -\u003e Abstraction Layer (ICommandExecutor, IStreamExecutor) -\u003e Mediator Layer (Commands -\u003e Handlers -\u003e Behaviors) -\u003e Business Logic (Routing, Provider Selection). Key Abstractions: ICommandExecutor.ExecuteAsync{TCommand, TResponse} with ValueTask, IStreamExecutor.StreamAsync{TCommand, TResponse} with IAsyncEnumerable. Pattern: Commands implement ICommand{TResponse}, Handlers implement Mediator's IRequestHandler, Streaming uses IStreamRequest{T} and IAsyncEnumerable, Transports delegate to ICommandExecutor/IStreamExecutor, Business logic lives in Handlers never in transports. Transport-Specific Code Location: Only in adapter packages, never in business logic. Consequences: Positive - single business logic implementation, easy to add new transports, testable, Mediator is source-generated zero reflection; Negative - learning curve for Mediator, requires understanding source generators, IAsyncEnumerable limitations in some transports, harder debugging with pipelines.

{"id":"Synaxis-d37","title":"Create Integration Tests for All Transport Implementations","description":"Objective: Create comprehensive integration tests for HTTP, gRPC, and WebSocket transports using Testcontainers and WebApplicationFactory. Context: Integration tests verify that transports correctly interact with the core Synaxis implementation, properly serialize/deserialize requests, handle errors, and support streaming. Testing Approach: Use WebApplicationFactory to host Synaxis with specific transport, Use Testcontainers for real PostgreSQL and Redis, Mock external providers (OpenAI, etc.), Test complete request/response cycles.

{"id":"Synaxis-g6k1","title":"Fix Remaining Analyzer Warnings","description":"# Context \u0026 Rationale\n\nThis issue is a catch-all for fixing any remaining analyzer warnings after completing P0-001 through P0-008. The goal is to achieve zero warnings across the entire codebase, which is required by the project's TreatWarningsAsErrors=true policy.\n\n**Why this matters:**\n- Zero warnings is required before proceeding to bounded context refactoring\n- TreatWarningsAsErrors=true means all warnings block builds\n- Remaining warnings may indicate code quality issues\n- Clean codebase is essential for maintainability\n\n# Technical Details\n\n**Current Warning Count:**\n- Total warnings: 232\n- P0-001 (SA1614): 88 warnings\n- P0-002 (S2325): 78 warnings\n- P0-003 (SA1117): 66 warnings\n- P0-004 (MA0051): 50 warnings\n- P0-005 (MA0002): Unknown count\n- P0-006 (SA1200): Unknown count\n- P0-007 (SA1633): Unknown count\n- P0-008 (SA1101): Unknown count\n\n**Note:** Some warnings may overlap or be fixed as part of other issues. This issue will address any warnings that remain after completing P0-001 through P0-008.\n\n**Implementation Approach:**\n1. Ensure P0-001 through P0-008 are completed\n2. Run dotnet build -warnaserror to identify remaining warnings\n3. Categorize remaining warnings by analyzer rule\n4. For each warning type:\n   - Research the analyzer rule and its purpose\n   - Understand why the warning is being raised\n   - Fix the underlying issue (not suppress the warning)\n5. Run build again to verify warning is resolved\n6.

{"id":"Synaxis-iui","title":"Create Synaxis.Contracts Project - Versioned Data Contracts with Messages Namespace","description":"Objective: Create the data contracts package that defines versioned data shapes for Synaxis SDK, using Messages namespace (not DTOs) under V1 versioning. Context: This package is consumed by both SDK users (compile-time dependency) and SaaS API (runtime wire format). Contracts must be stable, versioned, and designed for evolution. Critical Design Decisions: (1) Messages Namespace (Not DTOs) - Choice: Use Synaxis.Contracts.V1.Messages namespace instead of Dtos. Rationale: DTO (Data Transfer Object) is an implementation detail implying serialization, Messages conveys semantic meaning (these are the messages passed between components). Alternative Considered: Dtos, Types, Data. Rejected Because: Messages is semantic and clear, DTOs implies anemic objects, Types is too generic, Data is ambiguous. (2) Versioned with V1 Namespace - Choice: Synaxis.Contracts.V1.Messages for current version. Rationale: Namespace-based versioning allows multiple versions to coexist, enables gradual migration, makes version explicit in code. Future versions: Synaxis.Contracts.V2.Messages. Breaking changes only in major versions (V1 -\u003e V2). (3) Records for Immutability - Choice: Use C# 9.0 records for all message types. Rationale: Records provide value semantics, immutability by default, concise syntax, built-in equality/hashing, pattern matching support. Example: public record ChatMessage(string Role, string Content); (4) Init-Only Properties - Choice: Use init-only properties for flexibility within immutability. Rationale: Allows object initializer syntax while maintaining immutability after construction. Syntax: public string Model { get; init; } = string.Empty; (5) Nullability Annotations - Choice: Enable nullable reference types with full annotation. Rationale: Compile-time null safety, better IntelliSense, documents nullability contract. Pattern: Required properties are non-nullable (string), optional properties are nullable (string?). (6) XML Documentation - Choice: Require XML documentation on all public types. Rationale: Foundation for IntelliSense, enables GenerateDocumentationFile, professional API surface. Directory Structure: src/Synaxis.Contracts/ containing V1/ directory with Messages/ (ChatMessage.cs, ChatResponse.cs, ChatStreamChunk.cs, EmbeddingRequest.cs, EmbeddingResponse.cs, ImageGenerationRequest.cs, ImageGenerationResponse.cs, AudioTranscriptionRequest.cs, AudioTranscriptionResponse.cs, RerankRequest.cs, RerankResponse.cs, BatchRequest.cs, BatchResponse.cs, UsageInfo.cs), Commands/ (IChatCommand.cs, IChatStreamCommand.cs, IEmbeddingCommand.cs, IImageGenerationCommand.cs, IAudioTranscriptionCommand.cs, IRerankCommand.cs, ICreateBatchCommand.cs, ICancelBatchCommand.cs), Auth/ (IAuthenticationContext.cs, IApiKeyCredential.cs), Errors/ (SynaxisError.cs, ErrorSeverity.cs, ErrorCategory.cs, IErrorResponse.cs). Key Implementation Details: ChatMessage is record with Role, Content, optional Name, ChatResponse has Id, Object, Created, Model, Message, Usage, SystemFingerprint, UsageInfo has PromptTokens, CompletionTokens, TotalTokens, SynaxisError has Code, Message, Severity, Category, Details, IChatCommand implements Abstractions.ICommand{ChatResponse} with Model, Messages, Temperature, MaxTokens, UserId, OrganizationId, TenantId. Project File: References Synaxis.Abstractions only, TargetFramework netstandard2.1, Nullable enable, TreatWarningsAsErrors true, GenerateDocumentationFile true, PackageId Synaxis.Contracts, Version 0.1.0-alpha. Build Validation: dotnet build succeeds with zero warnings, references only Synaxis.Abstractions, can be packed to NuGet. Acceptance Criteria: Project builds with zero warnings, references only Abstractions package, all contracts use Messages namespace (not Dtos), all contracts versioned under V1 namespace, records used for all message types, init-only properties for optional fields, nullability annotations throughout, XML documentation on all public types. Risks: Versioning strategy doesn't account for all scenarios (mitigation: ADR-015 defines comprehensive strategy), namespace naming causes confusion (mitigation: consistent V1.Messages pattern, documented in ADR-015).","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","owner":"rudimar@outlook.com","created_at":"2026-02-08T12:05:51Z","created_by":"Rudimar Ronsoni","updated_at":"2026-02-08T13:15:49Z","closed_at":"2026-02-08T13:15:49Z","work_type":"mutex"}
{"id":"Synaxis-iuwt","title":"Fix SA1117 Parameter Alignment Warnings","description":"\n# Context \u0026 Rationale\n\nThis issue addresses 66 SA1117 warnings about parameter alignment in multi-line method calls. The SA1117 analyzer (StyleCop) requires that when method parameters span multiple lines, they must be aligned consistently. Proper alignment improves code readability and maintainability.\n\n**Why this matters:**\n- 66 warnings represent 28% of total warnings (232 total)\n- Consistent formatting is essential for code readability\n- Multi-line parameter lists are common in the codebase\n- TreatWarningsAsErrors=true means these warnings block builds\n\n# Technical Details\n\n**Warning Pattern:**\n```csharp\n// ❌ SA1117: Parameters should be on same line or each on separate line\npublic void Method(\n    string param1,\n    int param2, bool param3)\n{\n}\n\n// ❌ SA1117: Inconsistent alignment\npublic void Method(\n    string param1,\n  int param2,\n    bool param3)\n{\n}\n```\n\n**Correct Patterns:**\n\n**Option 1: All on one line (if fits):**\n```csharp\n// ✅ All parameters on one line\npublic void Method(string param1, int param2, bool param3)\n{\n}\n```\n\n**Option 2: Each on separate line, aligned:**\n```csharp\n// ✅ Each parameter on separate line, aligned at opening parenthesis\npublic void Method(\n    string param1,\n    int param2,\n    bool param3)\n{\n}\n```\n\n**Option 3: Each on separate line, indented:**\n```csharp\n// ✅ Each parameter on separate line, indented consistently\npublic void Method(\n    string param1,\n    int param2,\n    bool param3)\n{\n}\n```\n\n**Implementation Approach:**\n1. Run `dotnet build -warnaserror` to identify all SA1117 warnings\n2. For each warning, locate the method/constructor with misaligned parameters\n3.

Long methods are harder to understand, test, and maintain.\n\n**Why this matters:**\n- 50 warnings represent 22% of total warnings (232 total)\n- Long methods are harder to understand and maintain\n- Methods \u003e60 lines often violate Single Responsibility Principle\n- Long methods are harder to test and debug\n- TreatWarningsAsErrors=true means these warnings block builds\n\n# Technical Details\n\n**Warning Pattern:**\n```csharp\n// ❌ MA0051: Method is too long (80 lines)\npublic void ProcessData()\n{\n    // 80 lines of code...\n    // Multiple responsibilities mixed together\n    // Hard to understand and test\n}\n```\n\n**Correct Pattern:**\n```csharp\n// ✅ Refactored into smaller methods\npublic void ProcessData()\n{\n    ValidateInput();\n    TransformData();\n    SaveResults();\n}\n\nprivate void ValidateInput()\n{\n    // 15 lines of validation logic\n}\n\nprivate void TransformData()\n{\n    // 20 lines of transformation logic\n}\n\nprivate void SaveResults()\n{\n    // 15 lines of save logic\n}\n```\n\n**Implementation Approach:**\n1. Run `dotnet build -warnaserror` to identify all MA0051 warnings\n2. For each warning, analyze the method:\n   - Identify distinct responsibilities/logical sections\n   - Look for repeated patterns that could be extracted\n   - Find natural breakpoints for extraction\n3. Extract smaller private methods for each responsibility\n   - Use descriptive method names\n   - Keep methods focused on single responsibility\n   - Pass necessary parameters\n4. Update tests to cover new methods if needed\n5. Run build again to verify warning is resolved\n6. Repeat until all 50 warnings are resolved\n\n**Finding MA0051 Warnings:**\n```bash\ndotnet build -warnaserror 2\u003e\u00261 | grep \"MA0051\"\n```\n\n**Refactoring Strategies:**\n\n1. **Extract Method**: Pull out logical blocks into separate methods\n2. **Replace Conditional with Polymorphism**: For complex conditional logic\n3. **Decompose Conditional**: Break down complex conditions\n4. **Introduce Parameter Object**: For methods with many parameters\n5. **Replace Magic Numbers with Constants**: Extract constants\n\n**Example Refactoring:**\n```csharp\n// Before: 75 lines\npublic void ProcessOrder(Order order)\n{\n    // Validation (15 lines)\n    if (order == null) throw new ArgumentNullException();\n    if (order.Items.Count == 0) throw new ArgumentException();\n    // ... more validation\n    \n    // Calculation (25 lines)\n    decimal subtotal = 0;\n    foreach (var item in order.Items)\n    {\n        subtotal += item.Price * item.Quantity;\n    }\n    decimal tax = subtotal * 0.1m;\n    decimal total = subtotal + tax;\n    // ... more calculation\n    \n    // Persistence (20 lines)\n    using (var context = new DatabaseContext())\n    {\n        context.Orders.Add(order);\n        context.SaveChanges();\n    }\n    // ... more persistence\n    \n    // Notification (15 lines)\n    SendEmail(order.Customer.Email, \"Order confirmed\");\n    // ... more notification\n}\n\n// After: Each method \u003c60 lines\npublic void ProcessOrder(Order order)\n{\n    ValidateOrder(order);\n    var total = CalculateOrderTotal(order);\n    SaveOrder(order);\n    NotifyCustomer(order);\n}\n\nprivate void ValidateOrder(Order order)\n{\n    if (order == null) throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(order));\n    if (order.Items.Count == 0) throw new ArgumentException(\"Order must have items\");\n    // ... additional validation\n}\n\nprivate decimal CalculateOrderTotal(Order order)\n{\n    decimal subtotal = order.Items.Sum(i =\u003e i.Price * i.Quantity);\n    decimal tax = subtotal * GetTaxRate();\n    return subtotal + tax;\n}\n\nprivate void SaveOrder(Order order)\n{\n    using (var context = new DatabaseContext())\n    {\n        context.Orders.Add(order);\n        context.SaveChanges();\n    }\n}\n\nprivate void NotifyCustomer(Order order)\n{\n    SendEmail(order.Customer.Email, \"Order confirmed\");\n}\n```\n\n# Guardrails \u0026 Constraints\n\n**MUST:**\n- Refactor methods to be under 60 lines\n- Preserve all existing functionality\n- Run `dotnet build -warnaserror` after each refactoring\n- Ensure all tests pass after changes\n- Use descriptive method names for extracted methods\n\n**MUST NOT:**\n- Simply split methods without logical grouping\n- Add `\u003cNoWarn\u003e` to suppress warnings\n- Use `#pragma warning disable` except as temporary measure\n- Break existing functionality\n- Change public method signatures (unless necessary)\n\n**SHOULD:**\n- Follow Single Responsibility Principle\n- Extract methods that have clear, focused purposes\n- Keep related logic together\n- Update tests to cover new private methods if needed\n- Consider if extracted methods could be useful elsewhere\n\n**SHOULD NOT:**\n- Create methods that are too small (1-2 lines) without good reason\n- Extract methods that dont have a clear purpose\n- Make the code harder to understand through over-extraction\n\n# Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] All 50 MA0051 warnings are resolved\n- [ ] `dotnet build -warnaserror` passes with zero MA0051 warnings\n- [ ] All unit tests pass (`dotnet test --no-build`)\n- [ ] No new warnings are introduced\n- [ ] Code review completed\n- [ ] Refactored methods are more readable and maintainable\n\n# Dos and Donts\n\n**DO:**\n- Identify logical sections in long methods\n- Extract methods with clear, focused responsibilities\n- Use descriptive method names\n- Preserve all existing functionality\n- Run tests frequently during refactoring\n\n**DONT:**\n- Simply split methods at arbitrary line counts\n- Suppress warnings without refactoring\n- Break existing functionality\n- Create methods without clear purpose\n- Change public APIs unnecessarily\n\n# RFC 2119 Requirements\n\n**MUST:**\n- Fix all MA0051 warnings before claiming completion\n- Refactor methods to be under 60 lines\n- Use `dotnet build -warnaserror` for verification\n- Preserve all existing functionality\n\n**MUST NOT:**\n- Add `\u003cNoWarn\u003e` elements to any project file\n- Break existing tests\n- Introduce new warnings\n- Change public method signatures without necessity\n\n**SHOULD:**\n- Follow Single Responsibility Principle\n- Create methods with clear, focused purposes\n- Improve code readability through refactoring\n\n**SHOULD NOT:**\n- Over-extract into tiny methods without purpose\n","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","owner":"rudimar@outlook.com","created_at":"2026-02-15T20:02:35Z","created_by":"Rudimar Ronsoni","updated_at":"2026-02-15T20:02:35Z"}

{"id":"Synaxis-qgof","title":"E2: Ephemeral Scale Unit Architecture","description":"EPIC: Ephemeral Scale Unit Architecture (Hansjoerg Scherer Pattern)\n\nThis epic implements the ephemeral scale unit architecture following Hansjoerg Scherer's Azure Mission-Critical pattern. The design enables horizontal scaling through immutable infrastructure stamps that can be deployed, scaled, and destroyed on demand without impacting overall system availability.\n\nOBJECTIVES:\n- Design and implement three-tier ephemeral scale unit resources\n- Deploy ephemeral AKS stamps with automated lifecycle management\n- Enable multi-region active/active deployment topology\n- Implement stateless compute with externalized state management\n- Create stamp deployment and teardown automation\n- Establish inter-stamp communication patterns\n- Design stamp health monitoring and automated recovery\n\nARCHITECTURAL CONTEXT:\nSynaxis scale units represent independently deployable, ephemeral infrastructure stamps that can be provisioned in minutes. Each stamp contains:\n1. Compute tier: AKS cluster with node pools for workload separation\n2. Data tier: Regional Cosmos DB replicas, Redis cache instances\n3. Integration tier: Regional Service Bus namespaces, Event Hubs\n\nThe ephemeral nature means:\n- Stamps are treated as immutable infrastructure (cattle, not pets)\n- State is externalized to regional data services (Cosmos DB, Redis)\n- Deployment failures trigger automatic rollback and replacement\n- Scaling events provision new stamps rather than resizing existing ones\n\nSCALE UNIT REQUIREMENTS:\n1. Each stamp is self-contained with regional data affinity\n2. Stamps can be deployed in under 15 minutes\n3. Zero-downtime migration of workloads between stamps\n4. Automatic stamp health monitoring with self-healing\n5. Support for 3+ concurrent stamps per region for redundancy\n6. Cross-region replication for disaster recovery\n7. Stamp deployment via GitOps with ArgoCD or Flux\n\nCOMPONENTS TO IMPLEMENT:\n1. AKS cluster per stamp with system and user node pools\n2. Managed identities for AKS and workload authentication\n3. Azure Container Registry with geo-replication\n4. Regional Cosmos DB accounts with multi-region writes\n5. Azure Redis Enterprise for distributed caching\n6. Service Bus Premium for cross-stamp messaging\n7. Azure Front Door for global traffic management\n8. Azure Traffic Manager as fallback for region failover\n9.

{"id":"Synaxis-r4j","title":"Create ADR-014: Explicit Registration Pattern","description":"Objective: Write Architectural Decision Record 014 documenting the explicit DI registration pattern and prohibition of auto-discovery. Context: Synaxis has many optional components (transports, adapters, providers) and needs predictable, discoverable configuration without runtime surprises. Content Requirements: Title: ADR-014: Explicit Registration Pattern. Status: Proposed. Context: Many optional components, need explicit and predictable configuration, easy to debug, self-documenting. Auto-discovery causes runtime surprises. Decision: Use explicit DI registration only, NO auto-discovery, NO assembly scanning. Registration Pattern: services.AddSynaxis() for core, services.AddSynaxisTransportHttp() for HTTP, services.AddSynaxisTransportGrpc() for gRPC, services.AddSynaxisAdapterSignalR() for SignalR, app.MapSynaxisTransportHttp() for endpoint mapping. Naming Convention: Core uses AddSynaxis(), Transports use AddSynaxisTransport{Name}(), Adapters use AddSynaxisAdapter{Name}(), Providers use Add{ProviderName}Provider() inside options, Mapping uses MapSynaxisTransport{Name}() and MapSynaxisAdapter{Name}(). Per-Package Registration: Each package provides its own extensions, no central registration. Registration Order: 1. Core (AddSynaxis), 2. Transports (AddSynaxisTransport*), 3. Adapters (AddSynaxisAdapter*), 4. Use middleware (UseSynaxisTransport*), 5. Map endpoints (MapSynaxis*). What NOT to Do: No AddSynaxisAll(), no assembly scanning, no automatic transport registration, no convention-based configuration. Consequences: Positive - explicit and predictable, IntelliSense shows options, no runtime surprises, clear dependency graph, easy to debug; Negative - more verbose setup, must document registration order, easy to forget Map* methods, breaking changes require updating registration code. Implementation Notes: Use IOptions{T} pattern, validate at startup (fail fast), meaningful error messages if order wrong, consider source generators for validation.

{"id":"Synaxis-sxyl","title":"Fix S2325 Static Method Warnings","description":"\n# Context \u0026 Rationale\n\nThis issue addresses 78 S2325 warnings about methods that should be declared static but are not. The S2325 analyzer (SonarAnalyzer) identifies methods that do not access any instance state and therefore should be marked as static. Making methods static when appropriate improves code clarity, enables better optimization, and prevents accidental instance state access.\n\n**Why this matters:**\n- 78 warnings represent 34% of total warnings (232 total)\n- Static methods are more efficient (no `this` pointer)\n- Static methods clearly communicate they dont modify instance state\n- Prevents accidental instance member access\n- TreatWarningsAsErrors=true means these warnings block builds\n\n# Technical Details\n\n**Warning Pattern:**\n```csharp\npublic class Calculator\n{\n    private int _instanceField;\n    \n    // ❌ S2325: Method does not access instance state, should be static\n    public int Add(int a, int b)  \n    {\n        return a + b;\n    }\n    \n    // ✅ Correct: Uses instance field, should remain instance\n    public int AddToInstance(int value)\n    {\n        return _instanceField + value;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Correct Pattern:**\n```csharp\npublic class Calculator\n{\n    private int _instanceField;\n    \n    // ✅ Static: Does not access instance state\n    public static int Add(int a, int b)  \n    {\n        return a + b;\n    }\n    \n    // ✅ Instance: Uses instance field\n    public int AddToInstance(int value)\n    {\n        return _instanceField + value;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Implementation Approach:**\n1. Run `dotnet build -warnaserror` to identify all S2325 warnings\n2. For each warning, analyze the method:\n   - Check if it accesses any instance fields/properties\n   - Check if it calls other instance methods\n   - Check if it uses `this` explicitly\n3. If method truly doesnt access instance state, add `static` keyword\n4. If method does access instance state, the warning may be a false positive\n   - Document why it should remain instance\n   - Consider refactoring to separate instance concerns\n5. Run build again to verify warning is resolved\n6. Repeat until all 78 warnings are resolved\n\n**Finding S2325 Warnings:**\n```bash\ndotnet build -warnaserror 2\u003e\u00261 | grep \"S2325\"\n```\n\n**Special Cases:**\n- Extension methods: Must be static (already enforced by compiler)\n- Methods that call virtual methods: May need to remain instance\n- Methods in interfaces: Cannot be static (C# limitation)\n- Methods with `async` keyword: Can be static if no instance access\n\n# Guardrails \u0026 Constraints\n\n**MUST:**\n- Add `static` keyword to methods that dont access instance state\n- Verify method truly doesnt use instance members before making static\n- Run `dotnet build -warnaserror` after each batch of fixes\n- Ensure all tests pass after changes\n- Document any false positives (methods that must remain instance)\n\n**MUST NOT:**\n- Make methods static if they access instance state\n- Add `\u003cNoWarn\u003e` to suppress warnings\n- Use `#pragma warning disable` except as temporary measure\n- Break existing functionality\n- Change method signatures in breaking ways\n\n**SHOULD:**\n- Review method implementation carefully before making static\n- Consider if making static improves API design\n- Look for opportunities to refactor instance methods to static\n- Update method documentation if behavior changes\n\n**SHOULD NOT:**\n- Make methods static without verifying they dont use instance state\n- Ignore warnings without investigation\n- Create false positives by incorrectly making methods static\n\n# Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] All 78 S2325 warnings are resolved\n- [ ] `dotnet build -warnaserror` passes with zero S2325 warnings\n- [ ] All unit tests pass (`dotnet test --no-build`)\n- [ ] No new warnings are introduced\n- [ ] Code review completed\n- [ ] All static methods verified to not access instance state\n\n# Dos and Donts\n\n**DO:**\n- Analyze method implementation before making static\n- Check for implicit instance access (e.g., calling other instance methods)\n- Verify tests still pass after making methods static\n- Document any exceptions (methods that must remain instance)\n\n**DONT:**\n- Make methods static without verification\n- Suppress warnings without investigation\n- Break existing functionality\n- Ignore the warning if method truly doesnt use instance state\n\n# RFC 2119 Requirements\n\n**MUST:**\n- Fix all S2325 warnings before claiming completion\n- Verify methods dont access instance state before making static\n- Use `dotnet build -warnaserror` for verification\n- Preserve all existing functionality\n\n**MUST NOT:**\n- Add `\u003cNoWarn\u003e` elements to any project file\n- Make methods static that access instance state\n- Break existing tests\n- Introduce new warnings\n\n**SHOULD:**\n- Carefully analyze each method before making static\n- Consider API design implications\n\n**SHOULD NOT:**\n- Suppress warnings without proper investigation\n","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","owner":"rudimar@outlook.com","created_at":"2026-02-15T20:01:57Z","created_by":"Rudimar Ronsoni","updated_at":"2026-02-15T20:01:57Z"}

Test Strategy: (1) Compilation Tests - Verify Abstractions project compiles with zero warnings and zero errors, Verify zero external dependencies, Verify correct target framework. (2) Implementation Tests - Create test implementations of each interface to verify they can be implemented, Verify generic constraints are satisfiable, Verify covariance works (can assign ICommand{string} to ICommand{object}). (3) Contract Tests - Verify marker interfaces are truly empty, Verify async method signatures are correct, Verify CancellationToken parameters exist. Directory Structure: tests/Synaxis.Abstractions.Tests/ containing CompilationTests.cs (Build_Succeeds_With_Zero_Warnings, Has_Zero_External_Dependencies, Targets_NetStandard_2_1), InterfaceImplementationTests.cs (ICommand_Can_Be_Implemented, IStreamRequest_Can_Be_Implemented, ICommandExecutor_Can_Be_Implemented, IStreamExecutor_Can_Be_Implemented, IProviderClient_Can_Be_Implemented, Covariance_Works_For_Commands), MarkerInterfaceTests.cs (ICommand_Is_Empty_Marker, IStreamRequest_Is_Empty_Marker, INotification_Is_Empty_Marker). Test Examples: [Fact] public void ICommand_Can_Be_Implemented() { var command = new TestCommand(); Assert.IsAssignableFrom{ICommand{string}}(command); } private record TestCommand : ICommand{string} { }. Project File: Tests/Synaxis.Abstractions.Tests.csproj references Synaxis.Abstractions, uses xUnit, FluentAssertions, Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk. Coverage Target: 100% of public API surface (interfaces must be implementable). Acceptance Criteria: All tests pass, 100% compilation success rate, zero test warnings, interfaces proven implementable, covariance verified.","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","owner":"rudimar@outlook.com","created_at":"2026-02-08T12:06:04Z","created_by":"Rudimar Ronsoni","updated_at":"2026-02-08T13:15:49Z","closed_at":"2026-02-08T13:15:49Z","work_type":"mutex"}

{"id":"Synaxis-yeo","title":"SDK Core Implementation - Commands, Handlers, Behaviors, and Provider Packages","description":"Builds the core implementation layer on top of Foundation. Creates the Synaxis package containing command implementations, Mediator handlers, pipeline behaviors, and execution implementations. Also creates all provider packages (Synaxis.Providers.*) as separate NuGet packages. This is the engine that powers all transports and adapters. Scope: (1) Synaxis project with Commands/ (concrete command records implementing contract interfaces), Handlers/ (Mediator request handlers containing business logic), Behaviors/ (cross-cutting concerns via Mediator pipelines), Execution/ (ICommandExecutor and IStreamExecutor implementations using Mediator), Routing/ (provider selection logic). (2) Synaxis.Providers.OpenAI - HTTP client for OpenAI API, implements IChatProvider, IEmbeddingProvider, etc. (3) Synaxis.Providers.Azure - Azure OpenAI Service integration. (4) Synaxis.Providers.Anthropic - Claude API integration. (5) Synaxis.Providers.Google - Gemini API integration. (6) Additional providers as needed. Key Implementation Pattern: Commands are records implementing contract interfaces (e.g., ChatCommand implements IChatCommand), Handlers implement Mediator's IRequestHandler{T, TResponse}, Behaviors implement IPipelineBehavior{TMessage, TResponse} for cross-cutting concerns (logging, validation, metrics, auth, transactions), Executor implementations delegate to Mediator's Send and CreateStream methods. Pipeline Behaviors: LoggingBehavior (structured logging with correlation IDs), ValidationBehavior (input validation using FluentValidation or similar), MetricsBehavior (Prometheus metrics collection), AuthorizationBehavior (RBAC checks), TransactionBehavior (database transaction wrapping). Dependencies: Epic 1 (Foundation) must be complete with Abstractions and Contracts packages available. Success Criteria: Synaxis package builds with zero warnings, all handlers have unit tests with \u003e80% coverage, at least 3 provider packages created and tested (OpenAI, Azure, Anthropic), pipeline behaviors chain correctly, ICommandExecutor and IStreamExecutor functional, zero coupling between handlers (each is independent). Risks: Handler complexity grows quickly (mitigation: keep handlers focused, extract helpers), Provider APIs change (mitigation: version provider packages independently), Performance issues with Mediator (mitigation: source generators make it fast, benchmark if needed).","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"rudimar@outlook.com","created_at":"2026-02-08T12:04:33Z","created_by":"Rudimar Ronsoni","updated_at":"2026-02-08T14:17:36Z","closed_at":"2026-02-08T14:17:36Z","work_type":"mutex"}

The SA1633 analyzer (StyleCop) requires that all source files have a standardized copyright header.
